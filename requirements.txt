This requirements.txt file specifies the Python package dependencies required for the project. It includes core libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Torch, as well as NLP tools and datasets, testing frameworks, performance optimization libraries, logging and monitoring tools, and other utilities.

The specific versions of each package are pinned to ensure reproducibility and compatibility across different environments. It is important to update the versions carefully and ensure compatibility with other project components when making any changes.

This file serves as a crucial component of the project, providing the necessary dependencies for running the code and ensuring a consistent environment for development, testing, and deployment.
